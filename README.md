# JAABAvAnnotation
This repository contains code that analyzes the variability in human annotation of fly behavior from video recordings, and those that characterizes the correlation between human annotation confidence and confidence output from JAABA, a supervised machine learning program for automated animal behavior analysis. 

The code in this repository was used to conduct analysis and draw figures in the paper

Xubo Leng, Margot Wohl, Kenichi Ishii, Pavan Nayak, Kenta Asahina (2020). Quantitative comparison of Drosophila behavior annotations by human observers and a machine learning algorithm. Submitted.  

Further details of the code are described in Materials and Methods section of the paper.

## Contributions
Code in this repository is mostly written by Xubo Leng. It also contains several scripts modified from original work by Margot Wohl: specifically, they are MANvsJAABAduration_xubo.m, OrgData020816_XuboCopy.m and smoothing.m.
